            This site was independently developed by <strong>Brenen Olson</strong>, a senior Computer Science student at the University of Minnesota and the Trombone Team Lead for Season 134 of the University of Minnesota Marching Band.

            As team lead for the trombone section, I wanted to create a central place where everyone could find what they need, whether it's seating, schedules, or just general info. When I was a rookie, I remember how helpful it would’ve been to have one reliable spot to check in and feel more connected. This site is my way of making that experience smoother for the next generation.

            It’s built with the section in mind, clear, easy to use, and always evolving. Whether you’re brand new or a seasoned vet, my hope is that this hub helps you feel more confident, more informed, and more at home in Season 134.

            Thanks for being part of Season 134. Let’s make it unforgettable.
